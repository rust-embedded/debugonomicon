# Overview of embedded programming and debugging

This section intends to provide an overview of how to go about
programming and debugging microcontrollers on embedded hardware. Later
sections of this book will dive into numerous topics  from simply
flashing a binary onto a chip to single stepping through instructions,
inspecting memory and registers, instructing the CPU to halt execution
under certain conditions and wait for input, look for changes in
specific memory locations, etc.

## Why programmers and debuggers

### What are debuggers and programmers?

Generally, an additional hardware device is required to allow the host
PC you are developing on to connect to the target microcontroller. These
devices have several names such as debugger, debug probe or programmer.
Sometimes they are referred to by a specific brand or protocol they
speak, e.g. ST-Link, JLink. These devices are typically distinct pieces
of hardware, but in case you are using development boards, they are
often integrated into the board.

To add to the confusion, the software used to control the hardware
device, in our case `gdb` is also typically referred to as 'debugger'.

In contrast to creating software for a PC, the compiled program will be
running on a different device and needs to be transferred to the target
which needs to be instructed to execute the program. This is
accomplished by the *debugger* device. The debugger is therefor our main
tool to understand and debug the inner workings of the system being
developed.  These tools are very powerful and give the user complete
access and jurisdiction over a microcontroller, even to the point that
the user can rewrite arbitrary memory manually if desired. 

**SHOULD WE ADD IMAGES OF COMMON HARDWARE TOGETHER WITH SOME DESCRIPTION?**

## GDB

Our main option for debugging embedded targets is a version of
`gdb` specifically targetted to the processor architecture being used, for
example, `arm-none-eabi-gdb` for bare metal arm targets. Unlike
debugging on a local machine, the gdb instance and application code 
typically run on different devices. `gdb` supports this through the use
of servers and _remote targets_, whereby the debugger device 
implements the gdb server, and the gdb instance can connect to this to
interact with the running application.

While the invocation of GDB is typically independent of the debugger and
thus gdb server you are using, you may need to change the remote
server address when connecting and provide specific options (such as semihosting)
which are not universally available on all debugger devices. 

### Connecting

- Run `gdb ELF` where ELF is your output file to start gdb (ie. `gdb
  target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/release/hello_world`)
- Enter `target extended-remote :PORT` to connect to the gdb server (ie.
  `target extended-remote :4242`), note that this may be a TCP or serial
  port depending on the programmer
- Get debugging!


gdb will automatically execute commands from a `.gdbinit` file in the
directory from which it is executed, allowing you to automate the
connection to the gdb server and setting any breakpoints you might need.
A useful minimal example is:

```
	# Connect to the remote target
	target extended-remote :4242
	# Load the application
	load
	# Set a breakpoint on our entry to main
	break main
	# Start execution
	continue
```

### Useful Commands


In general gdb will interpret the shortest series of characters required
to uniquely identify a command as that command, for example `tar`
instead of `target`.

- `target extended-remote ADDR` connects to a remote target.
- `break LOCATION` or `b LOCATION` sets a breakpoint, for example `b main` sets a breakpoint on the entry to main.
- `print VARIABLE` or `p VARIABLE` prints the value of a variable at the point you are inspecting, `p\x VARIABLE` prints it in hex.
- `delete N` or `d N` deletes a breakpoint by index.
- `continue` or `c` continues to the next breakpoint.
- `step` or `s` steps through execution line by line.
- `backtrace` or `bt` prints a backtrace from the point you are currently inspecting.
- `load` flashes the current binary to the device.
- `run` re-starts an application.
- `layout LAYOUT` switches to different views, useful options are `SRC` for source, `REGS` for registers, `ASM` for assembly.
- `quit` or `q` gets you out, though you may have to interrupt with `ctrl+c` if the application is currently running.
- `source FILENAME` runs the commands specified in `FILENAME`.
- `set substitute-path SRC DST` substitutes paths that start with `SRC` with `DST`. This is useful for stepping into the rust sources as explained later.


You can invoke gdb with the source layout loaded by passing the `--tui`
argument in the command line. Note that `tui` mode starts with the
source view selected so normal control keys will scroll the source view
instead of the terminal, you can move through previous and next commands
with `ctrl+P` and `ctrl+N` respectively, or use `ctrl+x o` to move focus
between the source and terminal views and use your arrow keys and
page-up/page-down as normal.


You may encounter errors stepping through code concerning sources that
cannot be found.  In case the source paths contains hashes like:
`/rustc/e305df1846a6d985315917ae0c81b74af8b4e641/...` the cause may be
rust sources which were compiled on a build server in the directory
`/rustc/{commit_hash}`. To find this commit hash you can use the command
`rustc -Vv`. The `set substitute-path` command can then be used to
substitute this with your `{RUST_SRC_PATH}/lib/rustlib/src/rust`
(`RUST_SRC_PATH` can be found from the output of `rustc
--print=sysroot`). For example:

```set substitute-path /rustc/e305df1846a6d985315917ae0c81b74af8b4e641 "C:/Users/username/.rustup/toolchains/nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/lib/rustlib/src/rust"```

### VSCode Integration

The [Native Debug] extension can be used to debug Rust code directly in
the editor. To use it you will need to add a launch configuration to
your `.vscode/launch.json` file. Below is an example that starts gdb and
executes the commands specified in `debug.gdb`:

[Native Debug]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=webfreak.debug

```
"configurations": [
    {
        "name": "Remote debug",
        "type": "gdb",
        "request": "launch",
        "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
        "target": "${workspaceRoot}/target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/debug/hello", 
        "gdbpath" : "arm-none-eabi-gdb",
        "autorun": [
            "source -v debug.gdb",
        ]
    }
]
```

Make sure to change the `"target"` to match the destination of your
output file.

Before launching the debugger in VSCode you must ensure that
`JLinkGDBServer`, `OpenOCD` or other debugger of choice is running on the
correct port. Once running you can then set breakpoints in the code
margin and hover over local or global variables to see their current
value

![VSCode screenshot showing breakpoints and hovering over variables to see their value](./native_debug_vscode.png)




## Cargo run integration

The `cargo run` command can be configured to start the debugger. To use
this, simply add the following to the appropriate target in your
`.cargo/config`:

```runner = "arm-none-eabi-gdb -q -x debug.gdb"```

## Interfaces / Protocols

Two common protocols exist to communicate and introspect
microcontrollers: JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) and SWD (Serial Wire Debug).

### JTAG

[JTAG] has a long history, and was originally intended to daisy-chain multiple micro
processors, FPGAs, memory chips, simply anything which supports JTAG,
and access them over the same JTAG bus. To enable this, it requires more
signals than SWD:

* TDI (Test Data In)
* TDO (Test Data Out)
* TCK (Test Clock)
* TMS (Test Mode Select)
* TRST (Test Reset) which is optional

(a variant of JTAG called cJTAG, c for compact exists that uses 2
signals)

The following image illustrates a common communication example with a JTAG bus with multiple devices:

![Alt text](./JTAG_example.svg)

[JTAG]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JTAG

### SWD

[SWD] is quite similar to JTAG, as it uses the same protocol but it is
limited to two electrical signals and cannot address multiple targets on
a single connection. SWD is also a proprietary ARM technology.  While
JTAG is vastly more versatile, SWD's strength is in its simplicity as
many systems only have one microcontroller to program. In these cases
the reduction of signals while still having full debugability is a major
win. In SWD the following signals are available:

* SWDIO (Serial Wire Debug Input / Output)
* SWCLK (Serial Wire Clock)

The following image illustrates a common communication example with SWD
communicating with a single microcontroller:

![Alt text](./SWD_example.svg)

[SWD]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JTAG#Serial_Wire_Debug

### Which one to use?

When designing a system, we should select the interface which is most
convenient for the system, and there are simple criteria to consider:

- Does the target support SWD?
- Does the system have more than a single component which needs to be
  programmed or debugged? 
- How valuable is board space and is the larger area required for JTAG
  acceptable?
- What does the component manufacturer recommend?


## Debugging Applications

## Program Files

Depending on the debugger you use, you may need to convert your compiled
output to a different format. By default the compiler outputs a rich
[ELF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format) file
containing section information (and debug symbols if you have them
turned on). This information is useful to debug software, i.e. gdb, but
most microcontrollers require a very minimal binary (BIN) or
hexadecimal (HEX) file, consisting of only the program instructions.

[cargo-binutils](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cargo-binutils)
provides an `objcopy` command to convert between formats. Since
`objcopy` can only operate on a single file, as with all `cargo`
commands, the concrete target needs to be specified. For embedded
projects the target can either be:

* an application binary: specify this using `--bin NAME` where `NAME` is
  either the name of the crate (in this case the implicit target
  with code in `src/main.rs`) or the name of the binary as defined in
  `Cargo.toml`

* an example: use `--example NAME` where `NAME` is the name of the
  example source code in the `examples` folder

To create a bin file execute:

```
	$ cargo objcopy TARGET --release -- -O binary OUTPUT 
```

or for a hex file: 

```
	cargo objcopy TARGET --release -- -O ihex OUTPUT
```

where `TARGET` is the target specification as explained above
and `OUTPUT` the desired output filename. 

This is equivalent to using `arm-none-eabi-objcopy` for the same
purpose, but `cargo objcopy` is aware of the context can determine the
target output directory.

*TODO: do we always have to build with release to get reasonable binary sizes?*
*TODO: could cargo objcopy just do these things by default?*

## Common debugger platforms

### OpenOCD

[OpenOCD] (Open On-Chip Debugger) is a very popular piece of software
which provides an interface for a debugger software, such as GDB, to
connect to in order to provide in-system programming and boundary-scan
testing for embedded devices.

However, OpenOCD only provides the gdbserver for the debug software to
connect to and requires a debug adapter to connect to the target
microcontroller.

OpenOCD supports both JTAG and SWD signaling schemes throughsupported debug adapters. These are
typically connected to the PC via USB. These devices range from very cheap
eBay reseller devices, are built into evaluation boards from microcontroller
manufacturers, to very expensive, special purpose, adapters.

*TODO: list workable openocd hardware*


### [Segger JLink]

[Segger JLink]: https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/ 

Segger provide a JLink family of programmers and debuggers commonly used
in industry. JLink devices require closed source binaries to use,
however these are available for common platforms
[here](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/#J-LinkSoftwareAndDocumentationPack).
JLink probes are typically compatible with both SWD and JTAG based
debugging.

Flashing is managed using `JLinkExe` and a custom gdb server is provided
in `JLinkGdbServer`, the `JLinkExe` commands are documented
[here](https://wiki.segger.com/index.php?title=J-Link_Commander), note
that on windows this is called `JLink.exe`.

#### Programming

1. Run the `JLinkExe --speed 4000 --if SWD` command to connect to the debugger in SWD mode
2. Select your device with `device DEVICE` eg. `device EFM32G210`
3. Halt the processor with `halt` or `h`
4. Load your binary with `loadbin BINARY, FLASH_ADDRESS` eg. `loadbin test.bin 0x0000`
5. Verify your binary flashed correctly with `verifybin BINARY, FLASH_ADDRESS` eg. `loadbin test.bin 0x0000`
6. Reset the processor with `reset` or `r`
7. Quit the JLinkExe gui with `q`

It is also possible to pass scripts to JLinkExe with the
`--CommanderScript` option, allowing automation of commands.


#### Debugging

To debug with the JLink device you run the `JLinkGDBServer` command with
the specified device, speed, and interface. For example, `JLinkGDBServer
-device DEVICE -speed 4000 -if SWD`. You can then launch a GDB instance
with the appropriate command for your target (eg. `arm-none-eabi-gdb
BINARY.elf`) and connect to the GDB server using `target remote
localhost:2331` (specifying the default JLinkGDBServer port).

A common gotcha with JLinkGDBServer is interrupts not firing. If you
experience this issue then add `monitor reset` to the end of your GDB
initialization commands. You can also enable semihosting and print to
stdout with `monitor semihosting enable` and `monitor semihosting
IOClient 2` respectively.


### [ARM DAPLink]

DAPLink is a project by ARM to develop an open source cortex debug
probe, this provides a set of interfaces to simplify programming and
debugging and can be implemented on nearly any USB-capable hardware.
DAPLink provides a set of endpoints including a CMSIS-DAP interface for
debugging, a USB disk for drag-and-drop programming, and an optional
serial port for communication with the target system. The USB mass
storage approach, in which the target device appears as a thumbdrive in
the host operating system is useful for programming of devices in-field
as it requires no additonal software, however is not always reliable for
development use.

[ARM DAPLink]: https://os.mbed.com/docs/latest/tools/daplink.html


#### Programming

After connecting a DAPLink device to your system, a USB drive should
appear. To flash, copy your binary file (`*.bin`) to the drive and
wait for completion.


#### Debugging

TODO: try it out


### [STLink]

STLink debuggers are integrated on most ST development boards, and are
thus one of the most common programmers you will come across.

ST provides vendor utilities for programming on Windows, and these
devices are typically compatible with OpenOCD. You can also use the
[texane/stlink](https://github.com/texane/stlink) package which provides
a set of utilities to interact with STLink debuggers.

Note that while a STLink programmer might technically work for
programming / debugging any SWD compatible device, you are legally
prohibited from using it with devices not manufactured by ST.

[STLink]: https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/st-link.html


#### Programming

Flash with `st-flash --reset flash BINARY FLASH_ADDRESS` where BINARY is
your bin file, and FLASH_ADDRESS is the flash address to write the file.
You can also erase the memory wth `st-flash erase` which due to a bug
may sometimes be required prior to flashing. 


#### Debugging

Launch a gdb server on the default port (:4242) with `st-util` , check the help with `st-util --help` for other options.


### [Black Magic Probe]

The BMP (Black Magic Probe) is different from the other devices listed
here in that it does not require OpenOCD or other intermediary host
software to provide a gdbserver. Instead the device itself implements a GDB server
over serial port connection. In a
sense, it is OpenOCD combined with a debug adapter in the same dongle.
The BMP is open hardware and runs open source software inside it as
well, plus using GDB with the BMP very similar to OpenOCD. BMP is based
on a common STM chip and the firmware can easily be ported to other
boards.

### Debugger used in this book

This book uses the STM32F3Discovery platform for all examples, just like
the [Discovery Book] and [The Embedded Rust Book]. This eval board
integrates a STLink v2 debug adapter with which we will communicate
using OpenOCD.

[Discovery Book]: https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery/
[The Embedded Rust Book]: https://rust-embedded.github.io/book/


## Debugging Tools

There are currently two main debugging softwares on the PC side, the Gnu
Debugger (GDB) and LLVM's Debugger (LLDB). At the time of
writing this book, LLDB does not yet have the required support to debug the
targets we are using, and we will be using GDB in this
book.
